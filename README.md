# Authentication Methods - Comprehensive Guide

## Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive explanation of different types of authentication methods used across various industries. The documentation is structured into three levels of detail to accommodate different learning needs and expertise levels.

## Documentation Structure

Each authentication method is organized into three levels:

### 📘 Basic Level
- Clear definitions and fundamental concepts
- Simple examples from everyday applications
- Visual flowcharts showing authentication types
- Perfect for beginners and non-technical stakeholders

### 📗 Intermediate Level
- Detailed explanations of implementation details
- Industry-specific use cases and applications
- Real-world workflow examples
- Sequence diagrams showing authentication processes
- Ideal for developers and system designers

### 📕 Advanced Level
- Deep technical analysis of security protocols and standards
- Advantages and disadvantages in various contexts
- Future trends and emerging technologies
- Complex multi-method authentication scenarios
- Advanced workflow diagrams
- Suited for security architects and senior engineers

## Authentication Types Covered

1. **Password-Based Authentication** - Traditional username/password systems
2. **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** - Multiple verification factors
3. **Token-Based Authentication** - JWT and API tokens
4. **OAuth/OIDC** - Delegated authorization and authentication
5. **Single Sign-On (SSO)** - Unified authentication across multiple apps
6. **Certificate-Based/mTLS** - Public key infrastructure authentication
7. **Biometric Authentication** - Fingerprint, face, and iris recognition
8. **Passwordless Authentication** - Passkeys and magic links
9. **Adaptive Authentication** - Risk-based authentication
10. **Hardware Security Keys** - FIDO2 and physical tokens
11. **Device/Machine Authentication** - IoT and service authentication
12. **Session-Based Authentication** - Cookie-based web sessions
13. **HTTP Authentication** - Basic and Digest authentication
14. **Behavioral Authentication** - Continuous user verification

## How to Use This Guide

1. **Start with the overview** to understand authentication fundamentals
2. **Choose your level** based on your current knowledge and needs
3. **Explore specific methods** relevant to your industry or use case
4. **Study the diagrams** to visualize authentication flows
5. **Reference industry examples** to understand practical applications

## Industry Applications

- 🏦 **Finance & Banking** - MFA, Adaptive Auth, Hardware Keys
- 🏥 **Healthcare** - Biometric, Certificate-based, SSO
- 🛒 **E-commerce** - OAuth, Passwordless, Token-based
- 🏢 **Enterprise** - SSO, Certificate-based, Device Auth
- 📱 **Mobile Apps** - Biometric, Passwordless, Token-based
- ☁️ **Cloud Services** - OAuth/OIDC, API Tokens, mTLS

## Mermaid Diagrams

All workflows and sequences are illustrated using Mermaid diagrams for easy visualization. You can view these diagrams in any Markdown viewer that supports Mermaid syntax (GitHub, GitLab, VS Code with extensions, etc.).
